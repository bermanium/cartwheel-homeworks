    """Select the traces that the LLM judge will review.

    The returned plan keeps two kinds of traces separate:

      1. **Random sample.** Draw
         ``max(1, round(random_rate * len(traces)))`` traces uniformly at
         random without replacement, using
         ``random.Random(seed).sample`` on the traces in their given order.
         Only this sample may be used to estimate the failure rate.
      2. **Risk groups.** For each group in ``risk_groups``, include every
         matching trace. A trace can appear in more than one group.
      3. **All traces to judge.** ``to_judge`` contains every unique trace
         selected by either method. Deduplicate the traces by ``"id"`` and
         keep the random traces first, followed by the risk groups in their
         dictionary order.
      4. Each trace dict is passed through untouched; membership lives in
         the returned plan, not as mutations of the inputs.

    Args:
        traces: the batch, each dict carrying at least an "id".
        random_rate: random sampling rate in (0, 1].
        risk_groups: group name mapped to a predicate over a trace dict.
        seed: RNG seed; the same inputs and seed produce the same plan.

    Returns:
        {"random": [trace, ...],
         "risk_groups": {name: [trace, ...], ...},
         "to_judge": [trace, ...]}

        ValueError: if random_rate is outside (0, 1] or a trace has no "id".
